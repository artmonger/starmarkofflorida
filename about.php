      <h1>About Starmark of Flordia</h1>
      <h2>Chad Eversole, <em>Regional Manager</em></h2>
        <p>
          Chad has been with Starmark since the company began in 2004. He started working at Starmark’s parent company (Vandor Corporation) in 1998. Vandor Corporation does many things but began by making interior components for the casket industry. That casket interior business continues today. In July of 2016 Chad was promoted to Regional Manager for Starmark of Florida.

        <p>
          Chad has recently re-located to the Starmark of Florida Lakeland office to act as the Regional Manager. Those duties as well as managing Starmark of Florida’s marketing efforts (ad design, brochures, website, social media, conventions etc.) keeps him busy enough but that’s far from the only thing he does. He also has the opportunity to work with the R&D team and works hands on with Starmark customers. Chad graduated with a degree in Industrial Design from the Art Institute of Pittsburgh and received his certificate in Organizational Leadership and Supervision from Purdue University.
        </p>

        <p>
          When he’s not working he loves traveling and spending time with his wife of over 20 years and their 9 year old daughter. He also plays guitar (horribly), attends comic book conventions and plays the occasional video game.
